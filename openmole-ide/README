== How to add a maven dependency in the netbeans suite (ant project) ==

 * Add the maven dependency in simexplorer-ide-ant/simexplorer-cluster/pom.xml
 * run "mvn package" in the module simexplorer-ide-ant/simexplorer-cluster.
    It will copy the dependencies in the subfolder target/dependency.
 * run "ant" in the folder simexplorer-ide-ant for updating the cluster stored
    in simexplorer-ide-ant/simexplorer-cluster/target
 * check that appropriate file has been created in
    simexplorer-ide-ant/simexplorer-cluster/target/config/Modules
 * add the dependency to your netbeans module, either with the graphical wizard
    in the project properties, or by editing the nbproject/project.xml file
